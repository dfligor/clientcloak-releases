# ClientCloak Releases

Official macOS app releases for [ClientCloak](https://github.com/dfligor/clientcloak) — bidirectional document sanitization for attorneys.

## Download

See [Releases](https://github.com/dfligor/clientcloak-releases/releases) for signed and notarized DMG downloads.

**Current version:** 1.0.0

## What is ClientCloak?

ClientCloak replaces real party names with bracketed labels like `[Customer]` and `[Vendor]` before sharing documents — for AI review, working in public, creating templates, or sharing safely. A mapping key file allows restoring the original names later.

All processing happens locally on your Mac. No data leaves your machine.
