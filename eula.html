        <p><strong>ClientCloak End User License Agreement</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: February 2026</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and Making Reign Inc. ("Company") for the ClientCloak desktop application, including any associated documentation, updates, and supplemental materials (collectively, the "Software"). By clicking "Accept," downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>

        <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
        <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement and payment of applicable fees, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual license to install and use one copy of the Software on up to two devices owned or controlled by you, solely for your personal or internal business purposes. The Software may not be used on more than one device simultaneously by different individuals.</p>
        <p>This license applies to the major version of the Software you purchased (e.g., version 1.x) and any updates, patches, or minor releases within that major version provided to you as part of maintenance and support. A new major version (e.g., version 2.0) is not included under this license and may be offered separately under its own terms and pricing.</p>

        <h2>2. Open Source Components</h2>
        <p>The Software incorporates open source components licensed under the MIT License, available at https://github.com/dfligor/clientcloak. Nothing in this Agreement restricts your rights under the applicable open source license with respect to those components. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and an applicable open source license, the open source license shall govern solely with respect to those components.</p>

        <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, or create derivative works of the proprietary portions of the Software</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the proprietary portions of the Software</li>

        <p>Maintenance and support for the Software is included for 12 months from the date of purchase ("Initial Support Period"). During the Initial Support Period, the Company will provide bug fixes, minor updates, and reasonable email-based technical support. After the Initial Support Period, maintenance and support may be available for purchase under separate terms offered by the Company.</p>

        <h2>7. Updates</h2>
        <p>The Company may make updates available at its discretion. Updates provided during the Initial Support Period are included at no additional charge. Updates made available after the Initial Support Period may require payment of additional fees or an active maintenance and support subscription. The Company is under no obligation to provide updates beyond the Initial Support Period.</p>
